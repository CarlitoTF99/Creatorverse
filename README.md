## Notes

While building Creatorverse, one challenge was handling database schema differences (e.g., some environments used imageURL while others expected image_url). To keep development smooth, the app normalizes data on the client side. Another challenge was making external links (YouTube, Instagram, X) flexible—allowing any combination of them while keeping the UI clean. Styling was refined to make forms and cards compact and user-friendly. Overall I ejoyed making the all and having the chance to showcase my favorite content creators.
